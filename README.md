STILL IN DEVELOPING!

In this game you have to control a train, that has become an ark of salvation for the last survivors in this post-apocalyptic world. 

Your task is not only to manage the train, all its systems, to ensure that there is always food and water, but also to make sure that you remain in charge on this train. 

All passengers are divided into three classes. From the highest to the lowest. Each class is important, because only people of a certain class and profession can do the particular job. 

You have to make sure that people believe in you and your decisions. What to do with people - only you decide.
